**The real 2003 engine, compiled for arm64, playing skirmish matches on a tablet.**
No emulation: DirectX 8 → [DXVK](https://github.com/doitsujin/dxvk) → Vulkan 1.3 on a
bundled [Mesa Turnip](https://docs.mesa3d.org/drivers/freedreno.html) driver, loaded
rootlessly with [libadrenotools](https://github.com/bylaws/libadrenotools). RTS touch
controls: tap-select, drag-box, long-press right-click, two-finger pan, pinch zoom.

Ported in **under 24 hours** as a **human + AI collaboration** — possible only because
[Ammaar Reshi's iOS/iPadOS port](https://github.com/ammaarreshi/Generals-Mac-iOS-iPad)
and the [GeneralsX lineage](#credits) had already carried this engine across the hard
miles. **No game assets included** — bring your own Zero Hour
([Steam](https://store.steampowered.com/app/2732960/), ~$5 on sale).

## Get it

1. **Device**: arm64 Android with a Qualcomm **Adreno 6xx/7xx** GPU
   (others: [#9](https://github.com/fadi-labib/Generals-Android/issues/9)).
2. **APK**: [Releases](https://github.com/fadi-labib/Generals-Android/releases) →
   sideload ([Samsung gotcha](https://fadi-labib.github.io/Generals-Android/BUILD/ANDROID/#samsung-sideload-gotcha)).
3. **Assets**: push your own game files —

## The port in five walls

Five mechanics had to be discovered the hard way — each broke the port until fixed:

- **Vulkan 1.3 on a Vulkan 1.1 device** — the stock Adreno driver caps at 1.1, so
  bundle Mesa Turnip and load it rootlessly (via libadrenotools).
- **One Vulkan loader, not two** — SDL and DXVK each bring their own; the surface has
  to be created through DXVK's or the instance dispatch mismatches.
- **The one-producer `ANativeWindow` rule** — the engine's device-retry loop leaked the
  connection → black screen. Fixed by deferring surface creation to first present.
- **Shared libc++ across `.so` boundaries** — otherwise C++ exceptions and RTTI vanish
  at the boundary and the real Vulkan error gets swallowed.
- **A zero-initialized heap** — the 2003 code silently assumes `new` returns zeroed
  memory; bionic's `malloc` doesn't.

**The full story** — the renderer night, the 2 am black-screen hunt, the touch
deep-dive, and 17 cataloged bugs with root causes:

- Device testing reports are as valuable as code — especially non-Samsung Adreno.

## Credits

This project is the newest link in a chain, and says so gladly — the speed was
borrowed from years of work by:

- **Westwood / EA Pacific** — the game; **EA** — the GPL v3 source release.
- **[TheSuperHackers](https://github.com/TheSuperHackers/GeneralsGameCode)** — build
  modernization and cross-platform groundwork, with FFmpeg/OpenAL backends by
  [feliwir](https://github.com/feliwir).
- **[Fighter19's Unix port](https://github.com/Fighter19/CnC_Generals_Zero_Hour)** —
  SDL3 platform management, 64-bit fixes, the DXVK approach.
- **[fbraz3/GeneralsX](https://github.com/fbraz3/GeneralsX)** — the macOS/Linux port:
  compatibility layer, vcpkg build system, DXVK integration.
- **[Ammaar Reshi's iOS/iPadOS port](https://github.com/ammaarreshi/Generals-Mac-iOS-iPad)**
  — the direct parent and the single biggest reason this took a day, not months:
  the touch→mouse translator (adopted wholesale, then
  [evolved here](https://fadi-labib.github.io/Generals-Android/port/TOUCH_CONTROLS/) —
  improvements flow back), the lifecycle handling, the DXVK-on-mobile cross-build
  methodology, and the porting playbook that turned debugging into lookups. Want this
  on Mac/iPhone/iPad? **Go there.**
- **Mesa Turnip · libadrenotools ·
  [K11MCH1's drivers](https://github.com/K11MCH1/AdrenoToolsDrivers) · DXVK · SDL ·
  OpenAL Soft · FFmpeg** — the load-bearing walls.
