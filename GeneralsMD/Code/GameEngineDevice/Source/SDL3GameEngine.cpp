// iOS app lifecycle
//
// iOS suspends the process when the app leaves the foreground. Any GPU work
// submitted around suspension stalls on drawable acquisition (MoltenVK waits
// out a timeout per present), which surfaces as multi-second input hangs right
// after resuming. SDL warns that lifecycle events can arrive outside the
// normal poll cycle, so they are captured in an event watcher that fires
// immediately on the delivering thread; the engine update loop checks the
// flag and skips simulation + rendering while backgrounded.
// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
// Two independent reasons to halt the render/sim loop on iOS:
//  - BACKGROUNDED (home / switched away): the process is about to be suspended.
//  - INACTIVE (multitasking switcher open, Control Center, a notification
//    banner): iOS snapshots the window and owns the CAMetalLayer drawable during
//    this window — and crucially, opening the app switcher fires resign-active
//    WITHOUT a full background transition.
// Acquiring a Metal drawable during EITHER state fights iOS for the layer; across
// repeated suspend/switcher cycles MoltenVK is driven into an unrecoverable
// surface state and the app crashes (the reported "crashes after backgrounding /
// multitasking a few times"). Pause whenever either is set.
