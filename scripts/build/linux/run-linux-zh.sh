# GeneralsX @bugfix 09/03/2026 - Work around openal-soft 1.25.1 movaps alignment crash
# alcOpenDevice() crashes with SIGSEGV in a 'movaps %xmm1, 0x26260(%rbx)' instruction
# inside openal-soft's device initializer. movaps requires 16-byte alignment; if the
# ALCdevice struct is not aligned correctly, it faults regardless of which backend is
# selected. Disabling CPU extensions forces openal-soft to use scalar code paths that
# do not have alignment requirements. The pipewire backend is also excluded because it
# has its own crash at device-open time on PipeWire 1.4.x.
# These env vars are read by openal-soft's static constructor at library load time,
# so they must be set here in the launcher before the binary starts.
# User can override by setting ALSOFT_DISABLE_CPU_EXTS or ALSOFT_DRIVERS explicitly.
